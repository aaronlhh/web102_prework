## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

After completing the required challenges, I decided to add a navbar to the top of the page. By simply adding to nav-items and adjust the css, I notice that the logo-title pair is becoming far apart from each other, which is not what I desired. By looking through the flexbox documentations, the solution I came up is to put logo-title pair into a single div, and then flex with other nav-items, so that the navbar style is configured correctly with logo and title close together.
